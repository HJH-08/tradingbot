supervised learning regression
- compare x days, use machine learning to find best fit line with lowest MSE [ordinary least squares]
- setting the derivative of the sum of squared residuals to zero and solving for the coefficients (input values as matrix)
- Correlation as R^2
- linear regression line and 2 standard deviations for mean reversion strategy
- modify number of candles considered? optimisation
- combine with a moving average for momentum? or coefficient of linear regression?

k nearest neighbours (classification)
normalise data first so euclidean distance makes sense
features used are TAs like RSI, lag features like previous RSI, then plot in a multi dimensional space
hypertune k using grid search (1-31), cross validate (5-fold) to get k that gives highest accuracy
train the model: data next day, if close next day > close today: 1, else 0
result: worse than random ... sensitive to noise, more factors like new sentiment, all features are equally weighted (but 
the correlation is not equal)
