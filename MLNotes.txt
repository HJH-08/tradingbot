supervised learning regression
- compare x days, use machine learning to find best fit line with lowest MSE [ordinary least squares]
- setting the derivative of the sum of squared residuals to zero and solving for the coefficients (input values as matrix)
- Correlation as R^2
- linear regression line and 2 standard deviations for mean reversion strategy
- modify number of candles considered? optimisation
- combine with a moving average for momentum? or coefficient of linear regression?
